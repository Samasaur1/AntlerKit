# AntlerKit
The missing set of utilities, primitives, and bridging to allow for fast and expressive use of *SpriteKit* and *GameplayKit*.

## Motivation
Apple releases a lot of frameworks and APIs for developing for their platforms, including some tuned for game development. These are good, powerful frameworks. But the issue is, there are  a lot of them, and they donâ€™t come out of the box playing nice with one another. Combining these frameworks to build a full game is complicated, and (if done poorly) a real mess to maintain.

*AntlerKit* is the missing bridge between these systems. It houses all those Apple frameworks relevant to 2D games under a single, consistent, expressive API. Developers can start making their game do really neat stuff really quickly.

#### *AntlerKit* integrates frameworks for:
- 2D Rendering
- Physics
- Input
- Audio
- Scene and Gameplay Management
- Asset Management
- Update Loops
- Timers
- Mathematics and Geometry Utilities
